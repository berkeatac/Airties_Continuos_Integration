## Native Android Application for Continuos Integration Notifications##

This native android application uses Firebase to manage its database and user notifications by utilising Firebase API. By keeping users and their choices in the database, the application is able to send notifications to their users depending on their preferences. The names of the projects are dynamically pulled from a database managed by some other server using GET requests and parsing the incoming JSON file.
